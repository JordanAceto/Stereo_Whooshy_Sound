# Stereo Whooshy Sound

## This pedal accommodates various VCF plug-in boards and contains rich modulation features.
- The interface is loosely modeled after the Mu-Tron Bi-Phase with some additions.
- Flexible signal path configurations are possible, including true stereo, dual-mono, and series setups.

### Features:
- Guitar pedal style stomp box.
- Can accept a wide variety of [filter plug-in boards](https://github.com/JordanAceto/VCF_plug_in_boards).
- Manual frequency and resonance controls.
- Dual digitally generated LFO with morphing waveshaper, smoothly crossfades from triangle to sine to square to sample & hold.
- Analog envelope follower for when you want to quack and bwow instead of whoosh.
- CV/expression pedal inputs for each filter.
