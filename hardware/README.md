# The hardware for the pedal.

- The [main pcb](https://github.com/JordanAceto/stereo_whooshy_sound/tree/master/hardware/main_pcb) is the heart of the project.

- Once the pedal is built, you need at least two [VCF plug-in boards](https://github.com/JordanAceto/VCF_plug_in_boards) to complete the project.

- Various filter plug-in boards can be swapped in and out to experiment with sounds.

- The front panel and jack panel are simple pcb panels as a cheap way to get an ok looking finished project.
